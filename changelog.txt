* Publication of DEEB-DB_2022-11-01
* reduced required prediction time for lorenz63std from [100,150] to [100,120]
* removed method "Trivial"
* added interpolation methods (PwLin-Nn, Spline-IpGp, Spline-Nn, Spline-Poly2) for all models and Spline-True for polynomial models
* added further statistics (quartiles, min, max) to tables for aggregated scores
* added navi.html to navigate the evaluation pages more easily
* the example folders now also have a full set of estimations and evaluations

* For polyDeg2Dim2multi observations with truth number 10 and above have changed. All other observation stayed the same.
* Every model (including those with multiple trajectories) now has a full set of estimations from the estimators Const, Trivial, and Truth
* The evaluation has been improved and applied to all models and estimators. See <model>/evaluation/eval_scores.html and <model>/evaluation/showPlots.html
* The plots are created in a more systematic way and directly realted to the tasks
* The truth data is now split into several files: 
	- obs_truth<NNNN>.csv for the noiseless observation values
	- task<NN>truth<NNNN>.csv for true solutions of each task

	- DEEBdescription.html: corrected description of time step for prediction
